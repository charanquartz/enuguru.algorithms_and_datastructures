Bit fields can only be declared as part of a structure. The address-of
operator (&) cannot be applied to bit-field components

In C and C++, native implementation-defined bit fields can be created using
unsigned int , signed int , or (in C99) _Bool . In this case, the programmer
can declare a structure for a bit field which labels and determines the width
of several subfields.
