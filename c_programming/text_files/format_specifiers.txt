We should use “%zu” to print the variables of size_t length. We can use “%d” also to print size_t variables, it will not show any error. The correct way to print size_t variables is use of “%zu”.

In “%zu” format, z is a length modifier and u stand for unsigned type

List of format specifiers which generally used in programming

For example – If we want to read and print integer using scanf() and printf() function, either %i or %d is used but there is subtle difference in both %i and %d format specifier. 

%d specifies signed decimal integer while %i specifies integer
