The only things guaranteed about integer types are:

sizeof(char) == 1
sizeof(char) <= sizeof(short)
sizeof(short) <= sizeof(int)
sizeof(int) <= sizeof(long)
sizeof(long) <= sizeof(long long)
sizeof(char) * CHAR_BIT >= 8
sizeof(short) * CHAR_BIT >= 16
sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT >= 16
sizeof(long) * CHAR_BIT >= 32
sizeof(long long) * CHAR_BIT >= 64
The other things are implementation defined. Thanks to (4), both long and int can have the same size, but it must be at least 32 bits (thanks t0 9)
