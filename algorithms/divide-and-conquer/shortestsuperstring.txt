Shortest Superstring Problem

Given a set of n strings arr[], find the smallest string that contains each string in the given 
set as substring. We may assume that no string in arr[] is substring of another string.

Examples:

Input:  arr[] = {"geeks", "quiz", "for"}
Output: geeksquizfor

Input:  arr[] = {"catg", "ctaagt", "gcta", "ttca", "atgcatc"}
Output: gctaagttcatgcatc

Shortest Superstring Greedy Approximate Algorithm
Shortest Superstring Problem is a NP Hard problem. A solution that always finds shortest 
superstring takes exponential time. Below is an Approximate Greedy algorithm.

Let arr[] be given set of strings.

1) Create an auxiliary array of strings, temp[].  Copy contents
   of arr[] to temp[]

2) While temp[] contains more than one strings
     a) Find the most overlapping string pair in temp[]. Let this
        pair be 'a' and 'b'. 
     b) Replace 'a' and 'b' with the string obtained after combining
        them.

3) The only string left in temp[] is the result, return it.

Two strings are overlapping if prefix of one string is same suffix of other string or 
vice verse. The maximum overlap mean length of the matching prefix and suffix is maximum.

Working of above Algorithm:

arr[] = {"catgc", "ctaagt", "gcta", "ttca", "atgcatc"}
Initialize:
temp[] = {"catgc", "ctaagt", "gcta", "ttca", "atgcatc"}

The most overlapping strings are "catgc" and "atgcatc"
(Suffix of length 4 of "catgc" is same as prefix of "atgcatc")
Replace two strings with "catgcatc", we get
temp[] = {"catgcatc", "ctaagt", "gcta", "ttca"}

The most overlapping strings are "ctaagt" and "gcta"
(Prefix of length 3 of "ctaagt" is same as suffix of "gcta")
Replace two strings with "gctaagt", we get
temp[] = {"catgcatc", "gctaagt", "ttca"}

The most overlapping strings are "catgcatc" and "ttca"
(Prefix of length 2 of "catgcatc" as suffix of "ttca")
Replace two strings with "ttcatgcatc", we get
temp[] = {"ttcatgcatc", "gctaagt"}

Now there are only two strings in temp[], after combing
the two in optimal way, we get tem[] = {"gctaagttcatgcatc"}

Since temp[] has only one string now, return it.
