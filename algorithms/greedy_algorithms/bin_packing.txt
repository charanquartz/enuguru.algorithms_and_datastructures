Bin Packing Problem (Minimize number of used Bins)
Given n items of different weights and bins each of capacity c, assign each item to a bin such that number of total used bins is minimized. It may be assumed that all items have weights smaller than bin capacity.

Example:

Input:  wieght[]       = {4, 8, 1, 4, 2, 1}
        Bin Capacity c = 10
Output: 2
We need minimum 2 bins to accommodate all items
First bin contains {4, 4, 2} and second bin {8, 2}

Input:  wieght[]       = {9, 8, 2, 2, 5, 4}
        Bin Capacity c = 10
Output: 4
We need minimum 4 bins to accommodate all items.  

Input:  wieght[]       = {2, 5, 4, 7, 1, 3, 8}; 
        Bin Capacity c = 10
Output: 3

Lower Bound

We can always find a lower bound on minimum number of bins required. The lower bound can be given as :
   Min no. of bins  >=  Ceil ((Total Weight) / (Bin Capacity))
  
In the above examples, lower bound for first example is “ceil(4 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1)/10” = 2 and lower bound in second example is “ceil(9 + 8 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 4)/10” = 3.
This problem is a NP Hard problem and finding an exact minimum number of bins takes exponential time. Following are approximate algorithms for this problem.
