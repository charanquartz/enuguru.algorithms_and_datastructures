algorithm for deleting a binary tree completely (that is each node
has to be deleted)

void DeleteBinaryTree(struct BinaryTreeNode *root)
{
	if(root == NULL)
		return;
	/* first delete both the sub trees */
	DeleteBinaryTree(root->left);
	DeleteBinaryTree(root->right);
	/* deleting the current node only after deleting the sub trees */
	free(root);
}
