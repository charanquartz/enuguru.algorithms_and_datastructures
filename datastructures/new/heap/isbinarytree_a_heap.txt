Check if a given Binary Tree is Heap

Given a binary tree we need to check it has heap property or not, Binary tree need to fulfill following two conditions for being a heap –

    It should be a complete tree (i.e. all levels except last should be full).
    Every node’s value should be greater than or equal to its child node (considering max-heap).


We check each of the above condition separately, for checking completeness isComplete and for 
checking heap isHeapUtil function are written.

isHeapUtil function is written considering following things –

    Every Node can have 2 children, 0 child (last level nodes) or 1 child (there can be at most one such node).
    If Node has No child then it’s a leaf node and return true (Base case)
    If Node has one child (it must be left child because it is a complete tree) then we need to compare 
    this node with its single child only.
    If Node has both child then check heap property at Node at recur for both subtrees
