1) Create an empty Q.
2) Find all rotten oranges and enqueue them to Q.  Also enqueue 
   a delimiter to indicate beginning of next time frame. 
3) While Q is not empty do following
   3.a) While delimiter in Q is not reached 
       (i) Dequeue an orange from queue, rot all adjacent oranges.
           While rotting the adjacents, make sure that time frame 
           is incremented only once. And time frame is not icnremented
           if there are no adjacent oranges.
   3.b) Dequeue the old delimiter and enqueue a new delimiter. The 
        oranges rotten in previous time frame lie between the two
        delimiters.
