k = 3

k smallest elements

how to do this in quick time?

1. sort the elements in ascending by any sorting method, and get the first k elements

O(nlogn + k)  ~  O(nlogn)

build a min-heap and then delete min k times. then you get the 
k-smallest elements of the array


name of company   price
name  price


chennai   -  file 1

TVS          89.00
mahindra     91.00


mumbai   -  file2

TVS    -   90.00
mahindra - 95.00

there are 10 files  each file contains stock trade information
in sorted order of price

can you make one single file of all the stocks in 10 files merged in to one file but it has to be sorted

brute force method
you can take one file and take another file and merge


the first line contains the smallest price stock in all the files
why cant we compare all the first lines in all the files?
do a merge sort of all the first lines in all the files
then  do a merge of all the second lines in all the files
this is a merge sort

there are totally k files
there are totally n elements in each file

the best way of doing this is
build one heap for all the files
in that one heap which is a min heap, take all the k files present and 
put all the k stock prices in one stretch in that heap
klogk n elements are there in the heap

do this for all the n elemnts in the heap n(klogk)
